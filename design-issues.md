# Design Issues

## Flash - temp data that can passed via a redirect

Use case is: you want to redirect, but include a message or other info

Somehow: put it in the session, but make sure it's cleared after the page is done rendering?

## Logic useful to front-end and back-end - where does it go?

## Converting rich types in DB to and from strings needed for front-end
