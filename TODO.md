# One Week Sprint

1 - Get actual auth going with GitHub - timebox but should be good.
    DONE: - can use locally
          - can use on Heroku when deployed
2 - Make deploys seamless
    DONE: - inside DX, bin/deploy handles deployment to Heroku

3 - Add tags and deploy
    DONE: You can edit tags on any ADR with a minimal UX

4 - Test of a Ruby class
    DONE: Can write a test of an Action and run it easily inside DX
