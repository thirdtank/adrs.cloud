# One Week Sprint

CHECK 1 - Get actual auth going with GitHub - timebox but should be good.
          DONE: - can use locally CHECK
                - can use on Heroku when deployed CHECK
CHECK 2 - Make deploys seamless
          DONE: - inside DX, bin/deploy handles deployment to Heroku

      3 - Integrate CSRF into forms seamlessly
          DONE: All previous functionality works + deployed works

      4 - Add tags and deploy
          DONE: You can edit tags on any ADR with a minimal UX

      3 - Test of a Ruby class
          DONE: Can write a test of an Action and run it easily inside DX


# Parking Structure

* When auth'ing but email is not in the DB, what do?
* Deploy is very tied to Heroku
* db CLI is not as helpful as it could be
